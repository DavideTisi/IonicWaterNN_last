abstract = {We present an ab initio theoretical approach to accurately describe phonon thermal transport in semiconductors and insulators free of adjustable parameters. This technique combines a Boltzmann formalism with density functional calculations of harmonic and anharmonic interatomic force constants. Without any fitting parameters, we obtain excellent agreement ({\textless}5{\%} difference at room temperature) between the calculated and measured intrinsic lattice thermal conductivities of silicon and germanium. As such, this method may provide predictive theoretical guidance to experimental thermal transport studies of bulk and nanomaterials as well as facilitating the design of new materials. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Zhou2014,
abstract = {First-principles prediction of lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa$L of strongly anharmonic crystals is a long-standing challenge in solid-state physics. Making use of recent advances in information science, we propose a systematic and rigorous approach to this problem, compressive sensing lattice dynamics. Compressive sensing is used to select the physically important terms in the lattice dynamics model and determine their values in one shot. Nonintuitively, high accuracy is achieved when the model is trained on first-principles forces in quasirandom atomic configurations. The method is demonstrated for Si, NaCl, and Cu12Sb4S13, an earth-abundant thermoelectric with strong phonon-phonon interactions that limit the room-temperature $\kappa$L to values near the amorphous limit.},

@article{Tenenbaum1982,
abstract = {We have developed a technique to produce stationary nonequilibrium states in a molecular-dynamics system; this method is based on the introduction of stochastic boundary conditions to simulate the contact with a thermal wall. The relaxation times involved in such contact are short enough (10-11 sec) to make the technique suitable for computer experiments. The method allows the simulation of bulk properties in a system coupled with a heat reservoir and the study of the local thermodynamical equilibrium. Furthermore, it gives a physical description of the heat transfer near a thermal wall. The method has been applied to simulate high thermal gradients in a region of dense fluids ranging from the gas-liquid coexistence line to the freezing line, to check the validity of the linear thermal response (Fourier's law). We have found that the linear region extends at least up to gradients of the order of 1.8×109 K/cm for argon. In the bulk region where boundary effects are negligible we have verified the validity of the local equilibrium hypothesis for all simulated gradients. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

The first four chapters describe these methods in detail, and provide the essential background in intermolecular forces and statistical mechanics. Chapters 5 and 6 emphasize the practical aspects of writing efficient programs and analysing the simulation results. The remaining chapters cover advanced techniques, non-equilibrium methods, Brownian dynamics, quantum simulations, and some important applications. FORTRAN code is presented in the text.},

@article{Gillan2016,
abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

@article{Sit2005,
abstract = {The static and dynamical properties of heavy water have been studied at ambient conditions with extensive Car-Parrinello molecular-dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble, with temperatures ranging between 325 K and 400 K. Density-functional theory, paired with a modern exchange-correlation functional (PBE), provides an excellent agreement for the structural properties and binding energy of the water monomer and dimer. On the other hand, the structural and dynamical properties of the bulk liquid show a clear enhancement of the local structure compared to experimental results; a distinctive transition to liquid-like diffusion occurs in the simulations only at the elevated temperature of 400 K. Extensive runs of up to 50 picoseconds are needed to obtain well-converged thermal averages; the use of ultrasoft or norm-conserving pseudopotentials and the larger plane-wave sets associated with the latter choice had, as expected, only negligible effects on the final result. Finite-size effects in the liquid state are found to be mostly negligible for systems as small as 32 molecules per unit cell.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.},

In this approach, the density functional theory energy is distributed to each atom, and a two-step method in the molecular dynamics is introduced to avoid the atomic position R wrapping problem in a periodic system when the heat current is calculated. We show that this first-principles Green-Kubo approach is particularly suitable for disordered systems like amorphous and liquid, where the thermal conductivities are small due to strong phonon scattering but difficult to be calculated using anharmonic interaction energy. We have applied our method to liquid Ar, liquid Si, and amorphous Si. The calculated thermal conductivities agree well with previous theoretical and experimental results.

Based on these findings, we derive an expression for the adiabatic energy flux from density-functional theory, which allows heat transport to be simulated using ab-initio equilibrium molecular dynamics.

abstract="The Green-Kubo theory of thermal transport has long be considered incompatible with modern simulation methods based on electronic-structure theory, because it is based on such concepts as energy density and current, which are ill-defined at the quantum-mechanical level. Besides, experience with classical simulations indicates that the estimate of heat-transport coefficients requires analysing molecular trajectories that are more than one order of magnitude longer than deemed feasible using ab initio molecular dynamics. In this paper we report on recent theoretical advances that are allowing one to overcome these two obstacles. First, a general gauge invariance principle has been established, stating that thermal conductivity is insensitive to many details of the microscopic expression for the energy density and current from which it is derived, thus permitting to establish a rigorous expression for the energy flux from Density-Functional Theory, from which the conductivity can be computed in practice. Second, a novel data analysis method based on the statistical theory of time series has been proposed, which allows one to considerably reduce the simulation time required to achieve a target accuracy on the computed conductivity. These concepts are illustrated in detail, starting from a pedagogical introduction to the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and transport, and demonstrated with a few applications done with both classical and quantum-mechanical simulation methods.",
